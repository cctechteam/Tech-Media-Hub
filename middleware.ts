 * Next.js Middleware
 * 
 * Middleware function that runs before requests are completed.
 * Currently configured as a pass-through but can be extended

 * Potential Use Cases:
 * - Authentication checks before accessing protected routes
 * - Role-based access control for admin/supervisor pages
 * - Request logging and analytics
 * - Rate limiting and security headers
 * - Redirect logic for maintenance mode
 * 
 * Configuration:
 * - Matches all paths ("/:path*")
 * - Currently allows all requests to proceed
